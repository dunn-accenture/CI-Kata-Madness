# CI-Kata-Madness
The goal of this kata is to build the "muscle memory" of accomplishing all the goals needed to standup a basic CI pipeline that will allow a team to continously integrate their code and get instant feedback on their build status.

## A Note on Toolchains and Tech stacks
While this kata was developed using a GitHub/Travis-CI/Docker/Selenium tech stack, there is no one right way to play any of these cards. The ultimate goals is to incrementally grow the pipeline until all cards are played and the end result.
